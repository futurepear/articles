Realmz articles contraption
To make an article go into /articles/ folder and make a new file called [id].html 

For ids follow this convention:
"word-word-word"
Like new update 3.0 would be "new-update-3.0" 

To write stuff u put stuff inside of html tags 
U will use <h1> header and <p> paragraph tags 

Put them around text like a header would be <h1>ahjajaja</h1>
Then when ur done just let me know and I'll review it and publish it
