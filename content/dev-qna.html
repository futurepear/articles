          <li><b>Q:</b>Can you nerf the "small" upgrade? The speed bonus that comes with it is unnecessary, because being a smaller target is already a huge buff.</li>

          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>Do you have plans to add an adventure mode ? (multiplayer/singleplayer)</li>

          <li><b>Q:</b>Can you add the update where we can add and create our own servers and private rooms can friends can get invited to with the invite link? As the current 'add server' is confusing.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> This is a planned feature for the future. Right now the add server button can add a link to an existing server, but the only existing server is the main server.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>Either way, do you have plans to add a interactive tutorial (stoppable) that tells new players how to actually play the game, as new players may be confused of the current tutorial.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Yes, we will most likely add it with the client rewrite.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>What plans do you have to add to the game?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> We are currently working on rewriting the client and creating a new rendering engine for it. It will help reduce lag, make the experience smoother, and will make the game look much better. The client rewrite will come in a V3 update and will have a bunch of other stuff.</li>
