        <ul>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Will you add lava back in the game?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Yes. We haven't added it back yet because the current rendering doesn't support it. </li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> can you add badges</li>

          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> can you add puncher and katana to the tortement</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Puncher can be added, but not Katana. Katana is a low skill weapon.</li>

            <li><b>Q:</b> can you add rocketeer to the tournament weapon options</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> You can request it right before your match.</li>

            <li><b>Q:</b> How will you manage servers if the player-base gets up to 100 or more? The current servers can barely handle 60 - 80 players.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> According to our stats, the server can handle 60-80 players. However, we are running on the CHEAPEST servers so if we want to handle more players we will just buy a better server or buy more servers.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> why you add so many bats bruh, like bats in the entrance to the purple thingy, so can you like  get rid of some</li>

          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Can you please add a feature where you can see the entire leader board and all of the players? It would be useful for seeing who is online.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b>This is a planned feature. </li>
          <hr>
            
            <li><b>Q:</b> the game is getting a  bit boring, can you make it fun like extra ablites, healing, and more orbs, and have  a  new power up that can increase dmg to players and not to mobs but rarely shows up, and custom skins</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> More content will be coming soon.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> How did you make this Game?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> We created our own game engine using NodeJS (server side) and HTML/CSS/JS for the client.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> you should add nun-shucks, or a lotta reference around the map or on weapons.</li>

          <hr>

          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> When will more weapons be added </li>

          <li><b>A:</b> No, bats will be there to annoy everyone forever.</li>
          <hr>
            
            <li><b>Q:</b> I have an idea. Star skins, as when you reach a certain star amount, you get a special skin.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> That's a good idea and something that we are planning.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> What HTML/CSS parts are the hardest?(style etc.) Also could you make the mobs in crimson (red zone) smarter, along with adding a better tutorial with a guide to each class? =) </li>
          <li><b>A:</b> The hardest part of HTML/CSS is responsive design. How do you think crimson mobs could be made smarter? (You can let us know through the Q&A form). Also a better tutorial is something that's needed. </li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> can you add achievements</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> We will add them at one point.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> can you make pets? just to show not to help [they could help a little if you want]</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> This is a planned feature for the future.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> What do you think about the state of IO games and their decline? Will you eventually grow out of a IO game and become a indie game, or will you stay as an IO game?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> The decline of IO games isn't good for us. Realmz.io will always stay as an .IO game, but will also move to steam.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Which process of making the game is the most enjoyable and fun?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> The challenging parts are always the most fun - usually these are the more math and logic intensive parts of the game like physics, graphics programming, optimization, etc. </li>
          <hr>
             <li><b>Q:</b> What are the easiest and hardest parts of making realmz?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> The hardest part is always adding new mechanics (since we have a custom engine). The easiest part is adding skins or writing the changelog.</li>
          <hr>
             <li><b>Q:</b> What game engine and programming languages did you use to make realmz?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Realmz.io uses our own custom game engine that's made in NodeJS (server), and HTML/CSS/JS (client).</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> I want hacks</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Everyone does. Unfortunately, hacks cost $100,000.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> How do you defeat Warlock?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Long-ranged classes like Pulse Gun and Crossbow would work well against it because you can keep distance. Also practicing dodging attacks will help too.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> the bosses are not killable unless you complete challenges which is kinda annoying when scavenging for XP can you change that?  oh and hows your day been?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> That feature will not be changed. My day has been good - thanks for asking!</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> What plans do you have for advertising the game to get more players?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> This is something we thought about a lot. IO games have been in decline for a while so it's much harder to advertise now. Our plans right now are to buy ads and test their performance. Later on, we will focus on social media such as TikTok, youtube, etc. Right now we rely on word of mouth for advertising, which is working really well.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Could you make something where you could do the missions in any order? (except the boss ones) Because I'm having trouble defeating Warlock. Also could you make the portals only need 50% health?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> The missions are meant to be done in order because the rewards increase in value every mission. Portals require 75% hp so you are forced to complete a 1v1.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>Can you make the stars give slightly less exp people keep on farming and killing in the boss room until they get their final weapon evolution</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> We will look into this.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Will you add more weapons? Also upon death you lose 5 of your levels depending if that's fair because dying when you're level 200 and you go all the way back to level 35. Isn't fair dawg. (ex: level 20 -----> die -----------> level 15) (ex. level 300 ------> 280) just shorten levels upon death over time please.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> More weapons will be added. We will do a poll to see if the majority thinks you should lose fewer levels on death.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> I just need tips on how to kill Ancient Statue.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Short-range classes like Fire Caster or Excalibur can work well against it. Also, you will need to practice to dodge it's hammer attacks.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Can I help make the maps? I have geography skills, and I could make some suggestions, such as making the boss world "all connected".</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Contact us outside of this form if you want to help with development!</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Could you add maybe a new class? Maybe a new weapon after level 100? I can help with  coding. I have HTML certification btw.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> New classes will be added in the future. Level 100 classes will only be considered after every level 35 class has a level 70 upgrade.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> Can you buff all ranged projectile weapons? Projectiles are too slow and easy to dodge (people could literally run faster than some of them), and improving their speed could make the game more skill, cuz right now the meta is only melee weapons like champion and katana.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Maybe some ranged projectiles. We will also have to test this to see if it does improve PvP.</li>
          <hr>
            
          <li><b>Q:</b> Can you add lore to the game?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> There is some, you have to look for it.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> may i join ur dev team? i have numerous ideas for the game and think id be a great addition, if need be i can reach u again and give u like 10 ideas, all that have thought in them</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> In the developer team we want developers, artists, SFX designers, and marketers. If you have any of those skills you can email us at futurepearstudios@gmail.com or if you want to share your ideas you can email them.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> I looked in your Discord and saw that you have already made the private rooms. When will they actually come out, as you are just giving them out to winners only.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Private servers are currently a premium feature and you have to contact us to discuss pricing. There is a private server giveaway on the forum, and the winner will be chosen when update 2.8 comes.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> Can you add "disable skins" and "disable chat" options? Im tired of seeing people trashtalk all the time</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> There is a disable chat option in settings but not a disable skins option.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> Can you add more customization features? Like weapon colour, name colour, cosmetics etc.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> More cosmetics are a planned feature.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> Could you add more unique upgrades after 100 lvl, so the players have a reason to keep playing after reaching 100 lvl?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Not sure. Level 100 players are usually strong enough.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> Do you get any profit from realmz.io?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> We make a tiny amount of ad revenue that's enough to cover server costs.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> how u defeat goblin warlock easy and fast.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Use a powerful ranged weapon (maybe pulse gun) and get some friends to help you.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> Can we check mission at the same time while playing the game</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> You currently cannot, but we will add a feature for this soon.</li>
          <hr>

            
            <li><b>Q:</b> Can you add details to missions? As, the current system may seem confusing to a new player if they haven't researched the game.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Yes, that's a great suggestion.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b>Speaking of the admin permission in private rooms, what commands do you have in planning? Some suggestions I have are kick, level up (amount typed in), change weapon of (player) to (weapon), and spawn (entities like bosses, mobs, etc.)</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Those commands are already in the game and private rooms.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b>bruh how people do much damage to me when we legit have the same weapon and hes low too. </li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Upgrades like armor can give damage reduction at the cost of speed. </li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> How can I become a mod? I want to be able to stop people adding inappropriate names, and maybe a ban. I have HTML and CSS knowledge. Maybe a report feature</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Contact the developers directly.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> how u get gems</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> The purple gems (erthium) can be obtained through missions.</li>
          <hr>
            
        <li><b>Q:</b> what are stars for?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Stars are like account XP. It's a good indicator of how much you've played.</li>
          <hr>
        <li><b>Q:</b> In addition to the private room feature, will there be private room commands that can help us do random stuff in these said private room?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Yes. Whoever owns the private room will have some admin permissions in the room.</li>
          <hr>
         <li><b>Q:</b> can u add a slime boss to avenge the slimes that we have killed.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> In the future we plan to add some sort of slime boss. </li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> can we get a sneak peek at the V3 pls</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Sneak peeks will be released once we have a significant amount of progress completed. (Right now only half the new GUI is finished).</li>
          <hr>

             <li><b>Q:</b>so you know the "basic armor" button and other armor buttons. Can you put armor on the ball like showing </li>
          <li><b>A:</b>We can try. It might look funny on some skins though.</li>
          <hr>
             <li><b>Q:</b> Can you add a new weapon tree based off like tech? (Not the cyber weapons that are just high speed lasers) Like mech pets or mech exosuits and drones and engineering turrets.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> If we get some concrete ideas for classes and test them, then maybe.</li>
          <hr>

             <li><b>Q:</b>can you add like decorative tombstones? I don't just want to see plain old gray</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> The death screen could use an upgrade, so maybe.</li>
          <hr>
             <li><b>Q:</b> can you add like a friend box not to team up with people but you can friend them though</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> A friend feature may be added with a new client in the upcoming V3 version. </li>
          <hr>
             <li><b>Q:</b> Can you make the Death Sabre have slightly more damage? I understand that it's extremely OP as is, but it is not good for chasing. Also, with melee weapons, can you possibly add a throwing feature? It would make it easier for fighting people who run. Can you make skin crates like 200? Thank you for your time.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Adding more damage to it won't help much with chasing. Throwing melee weapons would be interesting but would take some time to code. Also skin crates will not have their price changed but we may do a sale soon.</li>
          <hr>
             <li><b>Q:</b> Could you make the railgun better? Maybe adding aim? Maybe you could make the gatling gun go through walls like sniper.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> In my opinion, Railgun is extremely powerful if used correctly. Also Gatling Gun would be annoying if it could go through walls. </li>
          <hr>
             <li><b>Q:</b>Can you add better upgrades, and maybe you could trade upgrades for better upgrades, using castaway. Because sometimes you misclick and get the wrong upgrade. </li>
          <li><b>A:</b>A feature where you can trade upgrades with the Castaway is interesting, we will consider it.</li>
          <hr>

            
            <li><b>Q:</b> Can you add a more interactive map? Maybe a legend?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> That is an interesting idea, we will take it in consideration.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Did you intend that stealth mode still shows the health bar when damaged? If not, please remove that.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> It is intentional.</li>
          <hr>

            
          <li><b>Q:</b> Can you use mouse to rotate weapons such as Aura Shield and Rune Caster etc... - the same control used for spear and pistol? Rotation currently is not controllable enough to make the weapon effective... no one uses these weapons...</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Rune Wizard and Cyber Blaster are meant to be hard to use. However, we can test rotating aura shield with the mouse to see if that is better.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> can you put a  make your clan section but you have to have a certain amount of something like coins or kills idk but pls </li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Clans will not be added to the game for a while because we do not want to promote teaming. It will not fit with the FFA gamemode.</li>
          <hr>
            
          <li><b>Q:</b> can u add peaceful music or battle music and when you go to the boss. put intense music</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> This is a planned feature, but it takes a lot of time to produce music so it may not come out for a while.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> can u make new weapons or secondary items like robotic arm or grapping hook</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Maybe. Features like that will need to be tested to see if they fit in the game.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> can u add a lot of powerful mobs because the grinding is a bit slow</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> You can go to the bottom left of the main map into the crimson caves or use the zombie portal at the bottom right to go into areas with powerful mobs.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b>How many NPCS like Castaway will there be in the game?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> No clue. Content for future updates hasn't been planned out yet.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Do you have plans to add more upgrades to the game?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> If we get good ideas, it's actually really hard to come up with good upgrade ideas.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Can you add the ability to look at your missions in game.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> We will try.</li>
          <hr>
            
          <li><b>Q:</b> Where would you take suggestions?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> You can join the discord server or forum to leave suggestions for the game. If you can't, you can go to the contact page and email us.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> What's going to come in the next update</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Our focus is on creating a V3 right now, but there will still be content updates. We haven't decided anything yet.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>what is the gold box mentioned by castaway ¨theres a gold box?¨, can we get it ¨i dont think you can get it¨, is there a hiden portal ¨I heard its underground¨, whats in it?
is it the underground in the boss world that there is not entrance if not what is that how to get in.?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b>You can't get in.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>Why if we go to level 60 then die we go back to level 35?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b>When you die you lose some of your levels, and the maximum level you can spawn at is level 35.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>zombie boss???</li>
          <li><b>A:</b>Thats Wormy from the Halloween gamemode. It may be added to FFA soon.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>all of the bosses are too easy can you make a harder one. Just an idea but maybe if you challenge the castaway and defeat him/her/it you can reset the boss timer. can you make castaway like the final boss?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b>We may add more difficult bosses or more difficult optional versions of current bosses, but there are no garuntees.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>Can you add a team battles?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b>Gamemodes will be added when the playerbase increases. There is no set date for this.</li>
          <hr>
            
          <li><b>Q:</b>Can you nerf the "small" upgrade? The speed bonus that comes with it is unnecessary, because being a smaller target is already a huge buff.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b>We will do a poll for this and decide based on that.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>Do you have plans to add an adventure mode ? (multiplayer/singleplayer)</li>
