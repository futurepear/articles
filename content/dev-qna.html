          <li><b>A:</b> According to our stats, the server can handle 60-80 players. However, we are running on the CHEAPEST servers so if we want to handle more players we will just buy a better server or buy more servers.</li>
          <hr>

            <li><b>Q:</b> the game is getting a  bit boring, can you make it fun like extra ablites, healing, and more orbs, and have  a  new power up that can increase dmg to players and not to mobs but rarely shows up, and custom skins</li>

          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> How did you make this Game?</li>

            <li><b>Q:</b> you should add nun-shucks, or a lotta reference around the map or on weapons.</li>

          <hr>
            
            <li><b>Q:</b> I have an idea. Star skins, as when you reach a certain star amount, you get a special skin.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> That's a good idea and something that we are planning.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> What HTML/CSS parts are the hardest?(style etc.) Also could you make the mobs in crimson (red zone) smarter, along with adding a better tutorial with a guide to each class? =) </li>
          <li><b>A:</b> The hardest part of HTML/CSS is responsive design. How do you think crimson mobs could be made smarter? (You can let us know through the Q&A form). Also a better tutorial is something that's needed. </li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> can you add achievements</li>

          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> What do you think about the state of IO games and their decline? Will you eventually grow out of a IO game and become a indie game, or will you stay as an IO game?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> The decline of IO games isn't good for us. Realmz.io will always stay as an .IO game, but will also move to steam.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Which process of making the game is the most enjoyable and fun?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> The challenging parts are always the most fun - usually these are the more math and logic intensive parts of the game like physics, graphics programming, optimization, etc. </li>
          <hr>
             <li><b>Q:</b> What are the easiest and hardest parts of making realmz?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> The hardest part is always adding new mechanics (since we have a custom engine). The easiest part is adding skins or writing the changelog.</li>
          <hr>
             <li><b>Q:</b> What game engine and programming languages did you use to make realmz?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Realmz.io uses our own custom game engine that's made in NodeJS (server), and HTML/CSS/JS (client).</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> I want hacks</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Everyone does. Unfortunately, hacks cost $100,000.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> How do you defeat Warlock?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Long-ranged classes like Pulse Gun and Crossbow would work well against it because you can keep distance. Also practicing dodging attacks will help too.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> the bosses are not killable unless you complete challenges which is kinda annoying when scavenging for XP can you change that?  oh and hows your day been?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> That feature will not be changed. My day has been good - thanks for asking!</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> What plans do you have for advertising the game to get more players?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> This is something we thought about a lot. IO games have been in decline for a while so it's much harder to advertise now. Our plans right now are to buy ads and test their performance. Later on, we will focus on social media such as TikTok, youtube, etc. Right now we rely on word of mouth for advertising, which is working really well.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Could you make something where you could do the missions in any order? (except the boss ones) Because I'm having trouble defeating Warlock. Also could you make the portals only need 50% health?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> The missions are meant to be done in order because the rewards increase in value every mission. Portals require 75% hp so you are forced to complete a 1v1.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>Can you make the stars give slightly less exp people keep on farming and killing in the boss room until they get their final weapon evolution</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> We will look into this.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Will you add more weapons? Also upon death you lose 5 of your levels depending if that's fair because dying when you're level 200 and you go all the way back to level 35. Isn't fair dawg. (ex: level 20 -----> die -----------> level 15) (ex. level 300 ------> 280) just shorten levels upon death over time please.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> More weapons will be added. We will do a poll to see if the majority thinks you should lose fewer levels on death.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> I just need tips on how to kill Ancient Statue.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Short-range classes like Fire Caster or Excalibur can work well against it. Also, you will need to practice to dodge it's hammer attacks.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Can I help make the maps? I have geography skills, and I could make some suggestions, such as making the boss world "all connected".</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Contact us outside of this form if you want to help with development!</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> Could you add maybe a new class? Maybe a new weapon after level 100? I can help with  coding. I have HTML certification btw.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> New classes will be added in the future. Level 100 classes will only be considered after every level 35 class has a level 70 upgrade.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> Can you buff all ranged projectile weapons? Projectiles are too slow and easy to dodge (people could literally run faster than some of them), and improving their speed could make the game more skill, cuz right now the meta is only melee weapons like champion and katana.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Maybe some ranged projectiles. We will also have to test this to see if it does improve PvP.</li>
          <hr>
            
          <li><b>Q:</b> Can you add lore to the game?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> There is some, you have to look for it.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> may i join ur dev team? i have numerous ideas for the game and think id be a great addition, if need be i can reach u again and give u like 10 ideas, all that have thought in them</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> In the developer team we want developers, artists, SFX designers, and marketers. If you have any of those skills you can email us at futurepearstudios@gmail.com or if you want to share your ideas you can email them.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> I looked in your Discord and saw that you have already made the private rooms. When will they actually come out, as you are just giving them out to winners only.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Private servers are currently a premium feature and you have to contact us to discuss pricing. There is a private server giveaway on the forum, and the winner will be chosen when update 2.8 comes.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> Can you add "disable skins" and "disable chat" options? Im tired of seeing people trashtalk all the time</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> There is a disable chat option in settings but not a disable skins option.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> Can you add more customization features? Like weapon colour, name colour, cosmetics etc.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> More cosmetics are a planned feature.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> Could you add more unique upgrades after 100 lvl, so the players have a reason to keep playing after reaching 100 lvl?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Not sure. Level 100 players are usually strong enough.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> Do you get any profit from realmz.io?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> We make a tiny amount of ad revenue that's enough to cover server costs.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> how u defeat goblin warlock easy and fast.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Use a powerful ranged weapon (maybe pulse gun) and get some friends to help you.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b> Can we check mission at the same time while playing the game</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> You currently cannot, but we will add a feature for this soon.</li>
          <hr>

            
            <li><b>Q:</b> Can you add details to missions? As, the current system may seem confusing to a new player if they haven't researched the game.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Yes, that's a great suggestion.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b>Speaking of the admin permission in private rooms, what commands do you have in planning? Some suggestions I have are kick, level up (amount typed in), change weapon of (player) to (weapon), and spawn (entities like bosses, mobs, etc.)</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Those commands are already in the game and private rooms.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b>bruh how people do much damage to me when we legit have the same weapon and hes low too. </li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Upgrades like armor can give damage reduction at the cost of speed. </li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> How can I become a mod? I want to be able to stop people adding inappropriate names, and maybe a ban. I have HTML and CSS knowledge. Maybe a report feature</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Contact the developers directly.</li>
          <hr>
            <li><b>Q:</b> how u get gems</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> The purple gems (erthium) can be obtained through missions.</li>
          <hr>
            
        <li><b>Q:</b> what are stars for?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Stars are like account XP. It's a good indicator of how much you've played.</li>
          <hr>
        <li><b>Q:</b> In addition to the private room feature, will there be private room commands that can help us do random stuff in these said private room?</li>

          <hr>

             <li><b>Q:</b>so you know the "basic armor" button and other armor buttons. Can you put armor on the ball like showing </li>
          <li><b>A:</b>We can try. It might look funny on some skins though.</li>
          <hr>
             <li><b>Q:</b> Can you add a new weapon tree based off like tech? (Not the cyber weapons that are just high speed lasers) Like mech pets or mech exosuits and drones and engineering turrets.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> If we get some concrete ideas for classes and test them, then maybe.</li>
          <hr>

             <li><b>Q:</b>can you add like decorative tombstones? I don't just want to see plain old gray</li>

          <hr>
             <li><b>Q:</b> Can you make the Death Sabre have slightly more damage? I understand that it's extremely OP as is, but it is not good for chasing. Also, with melee weapons, can you possibly add a throwing feature? It would make it easier for fighting people who run. Can you make skin crates like 200? Thank you for your time.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Adding more damage to it won't help much with chasing. Throwing melee weapons would be interesting but would take some time to code. Also skin crates will not have their price changed but we may do a sale soon.</li>
          <hr>
             <li><b>Q:</b> Could you make the railgun better? Maybe adding aim? Maybe you could make the gatling gun go through walls like sniper.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> In my opinion, Railgun is extremely powerful if used correctly. Also Gatling Gun would be annoying if it could go through walls. </li>
          <hr>
             <li><b>Q:</b>Can you add better upgrades, and maybe you could trade upgrades for better upgrades, using castaway. Because sometimes you misclick and get the wrong upgrade. </li>

          <hr>

            
            <li><b>Q:</b> Can you add a more interactive map? Maybe a legend?</li>

          <li><b>Q:</b> Can you use mouse to rotate weapons such as Aura Shield and Rune Caster etc... - the same control used for spear and pistol? Rotation currently is not controllable enough to make the weapon effective... no one uses these weapons...</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Rune Wizard and Cyber Blaster are meant to be hard to use. However, we can test rotating aura shield with the mouse to see if that is better.</li>

          <hr>

          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>Can you add a team battles?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b>Gamemodes will be added when the playerbase increases. There is no set date for this.</li>
          <hr>
            
          <li><b>Q:</b>Can you nerf the "small" upgrade? The speed bonus that comes with it is unnecessary, because being a smaller target is already a huge buff.</li>

          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>Either way, do you have plans to add a interactive tutorial (stoppable) that tells new players how to actually play the game, as new players may be confused of the current tutorial.</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> Yes, we will most likely add it with the client rewrite.</li>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Q:</b>What plans do you have to add to the game?</li>
          <li><b>A:</b> We are currently working on rewriting the client and creating a new rendering engine for it. It will help reduce lag, make the experience smoother, and will make the game look much better. The client rewrite will come in a V3 update and will have a bunch of other stuff.</li>
