<h1>Update 2.7 has arrived!</h1>
    <p>Soon, the old pre-2.0 map, "exodus", will be returning to realmz.io. However, there will be significant changes to accommodate for the map's return. This map has been tried and tested and is ideal for PvP.</p>

      <p>The map is undergoing a remaster which will include most of the current biomes in the game and new decorations.</p>

      <h1>Temporarily Removing Bosses</h1>
      <p>We decided that in the current state that advanced enemies and bosses retract from the realmz.io PvP experience. Bosses will be removed from the game for a short period of time until they will be added back in seperate worlds. Bosses will also have a cooldown timer.</p>
